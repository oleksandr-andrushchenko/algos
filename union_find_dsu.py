# ðŸ”¹ 15. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)

# ðŸ“Œ Pattern Explanation:
# Used for solving connected components, dynamic connectivity, and graph problems.
# Efficient for handling union-find operations in O(logN) or O(Î±(N)) using path compression.

# ðŸ“Œ Concept:
# Uses parent array + rank heuristic to find & union connected components.

# ðŸ“Œ Popular Problems:
# Number of Connected Components
# Redundant Connection
# Graph Valid Tree
# Friend Circles
