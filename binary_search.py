# ğŸ”¹ 6. Binary Search

# ğŸ“Œ Pattern Explanation:
# Used for searching efficiently in sorted data structures.

# ğŸ“Œ Concept:
# Reduce the search space by half at each step.

# ğŸ“Œ Popular Problems:
# Binary Search
# Search in Rotated Sorted Array
# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
# Find Peak Element
# Koko Eating Bananas
# Median of Two Sorted Arrays
