# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two
# adjacent and equal letters and removing them.
#
# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
#
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == char:
                stack.pop()  # remove the duplicate pair
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return "".join(stack)
