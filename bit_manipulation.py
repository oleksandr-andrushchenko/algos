# ðŸ”¹ 12. Bit Manipulation

# ðŸ“Œ Pattern Explanation:
# Used to solve problems involving bitwise operations, binary representations, and XOR properties.
# Reduces space complexity and can speed up operations significantly.

# ðŸ“Œ Concept:
# Uses bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>) to manipulate numbers efficiently.

# ðŸ“Œ Popular Problems:
# Find Single Number in an Array (Using XOR)
# Count Set Bits (Hamming Weight)
# Power of Two
# Reverse Bits
# Number of 1 Bits
# Missing Number (XOR)
# Find Two Single Numbers (Using XOR)
# Convert Decimal to Binary & Vice Versa
